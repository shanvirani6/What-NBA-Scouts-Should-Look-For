# What NBA Scouts Should Look For In The NBA Draft
**
Project Discription 
**

As it relates to the NBA Draft, teams and scouts have had much trouble in drafting consistent stars; Many describe the majority of picks in the NBA Draft as "busts," or players that do not live up to their potential. The intent of this respository is to provide a basis for what specifically NBA scouts should look for in the draft. In order to do this, there will be a variety of correlations between Career Points Per Game and many stats from the NBA Draft Combine.

Hypthoesis 
**

Multiple NBA teams design, and use python and R coding languages in order to ensure that their respective teams' draft the best available project. However, it seems that over the years, scouts may be searching for the wrong factors, such as points per game in college; And while searching for college points per game may not be a completely incorrect approach, scouts would be better off searching for correlations within the NBA Draft Combine in order to make better picks in the Draft.

Methods and Tools for Computational Analysis
**

This project will use a series of python code in Jupyter Notebook in order to perform proper analysis and find clear corrleations between Draft Combine stats and career points per game. Futhermore, datasets linked above such as, [2009ppg.csv], [2012ppg.csv], [2015ppg.csv], and [nba_draft_combine_all_years.csv], all found directly from basketball-reference.com and kaggle.com will be used as a starting grounds to provide clear infomration about each player being analyzed. Additionally, lucidtemplates.com will be used to make a storyboard containing thought processes, workflows, and more in-depth narratives about the topic, in order to better put together work.
