# What-NBA-Scouts-Should-Look-For
As it relates to the NBA Draft, teams and scouts have had much trouble in drafting consistent stars; Many describe the majority of picks in the NBA Draft as "busts," or players that do not live up to their potential. The intent of this respository is to provide a basis for what specifically NBA scouts should look for in the draft. In order to do this, there will be a variety of correlations between Career Points Per Game and many stats from the NBA Draft Combine.
